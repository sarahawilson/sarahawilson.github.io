# &raquo; About Me

I'm Sarah Wilson. A proud alumni of the University of Colorado at Boulder. I graduated in 2015 with a Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering.
I am currently employed as a Systems Engineer, working on state of the art technologies, at a top tier aerospace company. I believe in the power of diversity in the work place and am proud to be a woman in a STEM field.
When 40+ hours of being a rocket scientist is done, I'm either exploring the outdoors or thinking/writing about mathematics.
