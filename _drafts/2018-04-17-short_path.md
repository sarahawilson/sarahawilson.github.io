# The Shortest Path Problem - Graph Theory (4/4)

{:.postTagline}
## Something witty that will make people think you have a sense of humor

<!--excerpt.start-->
 The final post in this mini-series on Graph Theory! After building up some knowledge of what graphs are and searching them using [Breath First Search](https://sarahawilson.github.io/2018/04/19/BFS_graphs.html) and [Depth First Search](https://sarahawilson.github.io/2018/04/19/DFS_graphs.html) patterns, we can finally apply the mathematics to the real world. Graph theory is the basis that helps your GPS or cell phone find the shortest path home. Let's dive into one of the algorithms used to calculate the shortest path know as Dijkstra's Algorithm.
