# Depth First Search - Graph Theory (3/4)

<!--excerpt.start-->
The third post in this mini-series on Graph Theory! In the pervious posts we reviewed what graphs are and how to represent them using mathematic notation and looked at the [Breath First Search](https://sarahawilson.github.io/2018/04/19/BFS_graphs.html). Today we are exploring the Depth First Search.
