# The Shortest Path Problem

{:.postTagline}
## Something witty that will make people think you have a sense of humor


<!--excerpt.start-->
In 2016 I wrote the first entry for this blog: [The Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nisgberg](https://sarahawilson.github.io/2016/10/10/seven_bridges.html). This post described the question that kicked off the branch of mathematics known today as Graph Theory. Graph theory is the basis that helps your GPS or cell phone find the shortest path home. Let's dive into one of the algorithms used to calculate the shortest path know as Dijkstra's Algorithm.

For quick review this is a graph. The points where the lines intersect is a Vertex \\((v)\\) and the lines connecting the points are Edges \\((E)\\). Counting the number of Edges that touch a Vertex provides the Degree \\((deg(v))\\).
