# Making Changes

{:.postTagline}
## Out with Wordpress in with GitHub Pages


<!--excerpt.start-->
In 2016 I started up a mathematics blog called Experimental Imperfections. In
2016 I also seemingly ended that blog. Its demise was caused by three main factors:

<span style="color:#990000;"> 1. Free Time is a Limited Commodity</span>

<span style="color:#990000;"> 2. Tools are Everything </span>

<span style="color:#990000;"> 3. It has to be Relevant </span>

Spent some time fixing these issues and this is the result of those efforts.
Let the writing begin!

<span style="color:#990000; text-decoration: underline;"> 1. Free Time is a Limited Commodity</span>

I don't have ample amounts of free time. Shocker. When I do stumble upon some
I want to be using it efficiently. Spending 6 hours on a Sunday writing, editing and trying to get the posts look somewhat decent on Wordpress just wasn't going to cut it.

<span style="color:#990000; text-decoration: underline;"> 2. Tools are Everything</span>

Wordpress, is great but the endless menus, sub-menus and sub-sub-meuns
to change a font size or import an image were just too much. I needed something
minimal and that would allow me to have complete control over my content. Tools are everything, you can't expect to get anything done if you don't have the
right tools for the job.

The tools of choice this time around are:
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/)

I could write an entire post on each of these but the bottom line is
all of these tools are free, open-source, simple and just work.
The theme for this site is based on the [Cayman Theme](https://github.com/pietromenna/jekyll-cayman-theme), with some modifications.

I will highlight MathJax though, because just look at it. Just take a took at it.

$$
  \begin{align}
  \nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{E}}\, +\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{B}}}{\partial t} & = \vec{\mathbf{0}}
  \end{align}
$$

<span style="color:#990000; text-decoration: underline;"> 3. It has to be Relevant</span>

"Don't bother learning anything unless it's relevant and you can apply it somewhere in your life", is a quote from a co-worker of mine who is retiring soon. Writing about math is fun, but I didn't feel like what I was writing about was relevant in a way. I wanted
the new site to be more professional and a portfolio of my work. A resource for myself and others to review concepts, create a foundation in mathematics and create meaningful projects.

I have migrated the old content from Experimental Imperfections and made a few minor updates. Excited to see the possibilities of this new platform.
